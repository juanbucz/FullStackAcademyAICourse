    "   - Count how many days in the dataset have `rainfall_inches > 0`\n",

    "   - Print this probability with an interpretation (e.g., \"Based on our data, there's a X% chance of rain on any given day\")\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a theoretical binomial distribution**:\n",
    "   - Assume you're looking at a 30-day period (like a month)\n",
    "   - Using the probability from step 1, calculate the theoretical probability of getting exactly k rainy days for k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 30\n",
    "   - Use `scipy.stats.binom.pmf()`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visualize the distribution**:\n",
    "   - Create a bar plot showing the probability of each possible number of rainy days (0 to 30)\n",
    "   - Add a vertical line showing the expected value (mean = n × p)\n",
    "   - Label the axes appropriately\n",
    "   - Include a title with the probability of rain\n",

    "4. **Interpret** your findings:\n",
    "   - What is the most likely number of rainy days in a 30-day period?\n",
    "   - What is the expected (mean) number of rainy days?\n",
    "   - What's the probability of having 15 or more rainy days in a month?\n",

    "   - Take 1000 random samples from the rainfall data, each of size n=30\n",
    "   - For each sample, calculate the mean rainfall\n",
    "   - Store all 1000 sample means in a list or array\n",
    "   - Hint: Use `df['rainfall_inches'].sample(n=30, replace=True)` for each sample\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Visualize the sampling distribution**:\n",
    "   - Create a histogram of the 1000 sample means\n",
    "   - Overlay a normal distribution curve using the theoretical mean (μ) and standard error (σ/√n)\n",
    "   - Add a vertical line at the population mean\n",
    "   - You can use `scipy.stats.norm.pdf()` to create the normal curve\n",
    "   - Label axes and add a descriptive title\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compare distributions**:\n",
    "   - Create two side-by-side histograms:\n",
    "     - Left: Original rainfall distribution (from step 1)\n",
    "     - Right: Sampling distribution of means (from step 3)\n",
    "   - Make sure both use the same y-axis scale for comparison\n",
    "   - Include the mean and standard deviation in each subplot title\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Interpret** your findings:\n",
    "   - How does the shape of the sampling distribution compare to the original distribution?\n",
    "   - Is the sampling distribution approximately normal? (This demonstrates the CLT!)\n",
    "   - Calculate the standard error: population σ divided by √30. How does this compare to the standard deviation of your sample means?\n",
    "   - What does the CLT tell us about why we can use normal-based methods (like confidence intervals) even when our data isn't normally distributed?\n",
    "   - **Bonus**: Repeat the experiment with different sample sizes (n=5, n=10, n=50). How does sample size affect the spread and normality of the sampling distribution?"
